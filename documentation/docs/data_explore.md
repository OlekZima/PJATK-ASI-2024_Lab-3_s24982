# Data explore on College Distance dataset

## Introduction

---------

Given the [dataset](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/AER/CollegeDistance.csv) with cross-section data
from the High School and Beyond survey conducted by the Department of Education (USA) in 1980, with a follow-up in 1986.
The survey included students from approximately 1,100 high schools.

The goal is to create an ML model that will predict the `base year composite tets score` or just the `score` feature in
the dataset.

Rouse (1995) computed years of education by assigning 12 years to all members of the senior class. Each additional year
of secondary education counted as a one year. Students with vocational degrees were assigned 13 years, AA degrees were
assigned 14 years, BA degrees were assigned 16 years, those with some graduate education were assigned 17 years, and
those with a graduate degree were assigned 18 years.

Stock and Watson (2007) provide separate data files for the students from Western states and the remaining students.
CollegeDistance includes both data sets, subsets are easily obtained (see also examples).
