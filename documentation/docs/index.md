# Welcome to College Distances dataset exploration

The College Distances dataset experiment aims to predict students' academic scores based on various demographic,
socioeconomic, and educational factors. The dataset includes information such as parental education levels, income,
gender, home location, distance to college, and other indicators that might influence academic performance.

## Objective

The primary objective of this experiment is to train a predictive model that accurately forecasts student scores based
on a range of input features. By analyzing these relationships, the model can help identify the most influential factors
affecting academic success and aid in targeted educational interventions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes variables such as:

* **Distance to College**: How far the student lives from their college, potentially impacting commute time and study
  hours.
* **Parental Education**: Separate indicators for father’s and mother’s college education, representing family academic
  background.
* **Income Level**: Represents family income, indicating potential access to educational resources.
* **Home Environment**: Whether the student lives in a supportive home environment.
* **Urban vs. Rural**: Categorizes students based on urban or rural residence, which can affect access to resources.
* **Other Demographic Variables**: Gender, ethnicity, and region to capture broader socio-demographic factors.

## Experiment Approach

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling
   numerical values.
2. Feature Engineering: Transform variables, such as converting categorical variables into binary or one-hot encoded
   features.
3. Model Development: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or
   neural networks) to find the best predictive approach for student scores.
4. Performance Evaluation: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R² to assess model
   accuracy.

## Expected Outcome

The expected outcome is a model that can reliably predict student scores based on the provided features, along with
insights into which factors have the greatest impact on academic success. This experiment could potentially aid
educational policymakers in identifying at-risk students and tailoring resources to optimize learning outcomes.
